# TODO: Implement Different Headers and Footers for Admin and Doctor Dashboards

## Steps to Complete

- [ ] Create `views/includes/adminHeader.ejs`: Customized header for admin dashboard, using same CSS (navbar.css).
- [ ] Create `views/includes/adminFooter.ejs`: Customized footer for admin dashboard, using same CSS as shared footer.
- [ ] Create `views/includes/doctorHeader.ejs`: Customized header for doctor dashboard, using same CSS (navbar.css).
- [ ] Create `views/includes/doctorFooter.ejs`: Customized footer for doctor dashboard, using same CSS as shared footer.
- [ ] Update `views/adminDashboard.ejs`: Change includes to use `adminHeader` and `adminFooter` instead of shared ones.
- [ ] Update `views/doctorDashboard.ejs`: Change includes to use `doctorHeader` and `doctorFooter` instead of shared ones.
- [ ] Test the dashboards to ensure they render correctly with new headers/footers.
- [ ] Update any CSS if necessary for the new includes (though using same CSS as other pages).
